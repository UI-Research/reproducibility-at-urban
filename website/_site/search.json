    "text": "Git vs. GitHub\nGit is a free, open source distributed version-control system for tracking changes in code. Because Git is installed and maintained locally on your computer, it can be used without an internet connection. It’s like a turbo-charged version of Word’s track changes for code.\nGitHub is a cloud-based, online hosting service for version control using Git. It also contains useful tools for collaboration and project management. It’s like a turbo-charged version of Box for sharing Git repositories (i.e. folders tracked by Git).\nDon’t get bogged down in the details – just remember that Git is a local version control system, while GitHub is a hosting site for backup and collaboration. Together, they pack a powerful punch."
