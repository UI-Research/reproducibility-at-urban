There are other tools to interact with Git using a visual interface (like GitHub Desktop, or RStudio’s built in Git integration). These tools may be helpful, but we recommend starting by reading this guide and understanding how Git works. Under the hood, all those visual interfaces just use the command line.\nTo run Git commands from the command line on a Windows computer, right click within any directory (i.e. folder) on your computer, and select Git Bash Here. Alternatively, if you already use an IDE like RStudio or VS Code, you can use the terminal within these IDEs directly to run commands. You can also read more about the command line in this tutorial.\nThroughout this guide, &lt;&gt; indicate blanks that need to be filled in.

Give the repository a name, and click Create Repository.\nOn GitHub, navigate to the repo that you just created and click the green button titled Code (top right corner). Copy the HTTPS remote URL. It will look like https://github.com/UI-Research/&lt;name_of_your_repo&gt;.git.\nNavigate to the directory where you want to keep the repo on your computer.

Copy the HTTPS remote URL. It will look like https://github.com/UI-Research/&lt;name_of_your_repo&gt;.git.\nNavigate to the directory where you want to keep the repo on your computer. Using the URL that you copied in the last step, clone the repository:\n\n\ngit clone &lt;remote_url_for_your_repo&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Adding collaborators to a repository\nTo share the repository with others, navigate to the GitHub page for the repo. Then, click Settings (along the top) and Collaborators and Teams (along the left side panel). Click the relevant buttons to add people (individual users) or teams (groups of users).\nTeams are useful if you have a set of users who will all need access to multiple repositories. Creating a team saves you from having to add each user individually for each new repo. Urban has 50+ teams on GitHub for specific projects (e.g. Education Data Team for folks across TECH, COMMS, and EDP who work on the Education Data Portal) or teams or centers within Urban (e.g. Data Science or HFPC).\n\n\n2.5 Basic commands and workflow\nThe most common Git commands you will use include git add, git commit, and git push. These tell Git which files to track, when to take snapshots of those files, and when to send those snapshots to GitHub for others to see.\ngit add adds a file to Git’s staging area. It tells Git, “Hey, look at this file.”\ngit add &lt;file_name&gt;\ngit commit commits changes made to added files to the repository. It says, “Hey, take a snapshot of the files I’ve added.”\ngit commit -m \"&lt;message&gt;\" \ngit status prints out important information about your repo. Use it before and after most commands to understand how files have changed in your repo.\ngit status \ngit push pushes your local commits to the remote repository on GitHub. It says, “hey, push all my snapshots to a shared folder so that other people can see them.” The command below will push to the default main branch of your repo. Note that for repositories created before August 2021, the default branch was called master, instead of main.\ngit push origin main\nBefore running the git push command, your code and commits could only be accessed on your local computer."

    "section": "3 Collaborative workflow",
    "text": "3 Collaborative workflow\nThe main benefit of version control is making sure you and your collaborators are all using the latest and greatest version of your code. When working individually, this will just be your local version. When working with others, you should pull down the latest changes that anyone has pushed remotely before making further updates.\ngit pull copies the latest changes that anyone has pushed remotely to your local repository. It says, “Hey, replace my local version with the current version on GitHub.” The command below will pull the latest version on the main branch.\ngit pull origin main\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1 Branches\nSo far in this guide, we’ve been working off a single main branch. By using multiple branches, you and your collaborators can update existing code or add new code without the fear of overwriting each others’ files. Branches let you say “Hey, I’m going to leave the main version of the code alone while I try some things out over here.”\n\n\n\n\n\ngit checkout switches your local version to different branch. The -b flag in the command below tells Git to first create a new branch and then switch to it. When you first create a new branch, it will be identical to the local version of the branch that you switched from (typically the main branch).\ngit checkout -b &lt;name_of_new_branch&gt; \ngit branch will tell you what branch you are currently on. It’s always a good idea to run git branch before pushing.\ngit branch\ngit push sends your local commits to the remote repository, as noted earlier. To push to a specific branch, specify the branch name in the command. If you don’t explicitly specify a branch, Git will push to whichever branch you are on.\ngit push origin &lt;name_of_new_branch&gt; \n\n\n3.2 Pull requests\nWhen you’re ready to share the updates on your branch with others, open a pull request. This says, “Hey, I’d like to merge the work on my branch into the main (or some other) branch.” Pull requests makes it easy for others to see the changes you’ve made and provide feedback. They also help organize multiple related commits into a single update.\nThe most common way to open, review, and merge a pull request is through GitHub, rather than from the command line. Different teams develop their own standards for branching and pull requests, but here’s a common workflow:\n\nFrom your repo, click Pull requests (along the top) and then click the green New pull request button.\nSelect the branch with your work. By default, GitHub will create a pull request into the main branch.\nReview the files that have changed to ensure you don’t accidentally merge files you don’t intend to into the main branch.\nClick Create pull request. Write a summary of the updates included in the pull request and why you made those updates. You can also add Reviewers (along the right panel) to notify others that you would like them to look at your changes.\nTo make changes to the code included in a pull request if (e.g. if a reviewer requests updates), simply push to the same branch. The pull request will automatically be updated to reflect these changes.\nOnce approved, merge the pull request into the main branch by clicking the green Merge or Rebase and merge button.\nOnce your branch has been merged, delete it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter merging the pull request, you should return to the main branch and sync your local directory with the merged changes:\ngit checkout switches your local version to a different branch.\ngit checkout main\ngit pull copies the latest changes from the pull request that you just merged remotely to your local repository. If you don’t explicitly specify a branch when running the git pull command, Git will pull from the branch you are currently on.\ngit pull"

Once you’re comfortable with those steps, find a colleague to work with you on the main branch and start pulling their updates. Before long, you’ll have that workflow down and will be ready to start using multiple branches and opening pull requests.\nThis guide is meant to be an introduction. Git and GitHub have hundreds of useful commands and features not discussed here. Different folks and teams also have different opinions on workflows and best practices for using these tools. Once you have a grasp of the basics, we encourage you to start exploring to find a workflow that works for you.\nYou will inevitably run into errors along the way, but learning how to resolve those will make you a better researcher, programmer, and problem solver. Don’t be afraid to ask for help – the #github Slack channel is a great place to start!\nLastly, remember that if things ever go horribly wrong, you can use the inelegant (but effective) “burn it all down” technique to return to a happy state: save your work elsewhere, delete the project folder, and clone a fresh copy of the repository."

They accomplish this by making it easy to take a snapshot of the version of packages used in a project and restore that snapshot on other computers. They also make it easy to switch between snapshots on a single computer as you switch between projects.\nTo make this more concrete, here’s a few situations when setting up a virtual environment can save you several hours (or even days!) of frustration:\n\nYou published an analysis based on 2021 data. A year later, you want to update the analysis with 2022 data, but your code no longer works because a function in a package was updated.\nYour coworker is running into errors running your code because of differences in package versions between your computers.\nYou need to use Python 2.7 for a legacy project, while using Python 3.7 for all other projects.\nYou want to use a new library that has known compatibility issues with Python 3.8 on Windows computers, so you want to use Python 3.7 for just one specific project.\nYou got a new computer and don’t want to spend hours remembering which R packages to install through endless Error in library(&lt;&gt;): there is no package called '&lt;&gt;' errors.\nYour code takes a long time to run locally, so you want to leverage powerful virtual computers in the cloud - or scale to use tens, hundreds, or thousands of computers simultaneously - but you first need to install the relevant packages on the virtual machine(s).\n\nImportantly, virtual environments are just one piece of reproducible research workflows - they are NOT replacements for other important components of reproducibility like version control, directory management, or data provenance."

Getting into the habit of using virtual environments for smaller projects will also help you develop confidence when using them for larger projects with more collaborators and complex dependencies.\nWhile the best time to set up a virtual environment for a project is at the very beginning (right after initializing your GitHub repository), the second best time is right now - whether you’re halfway through writing your code, ready to publish your results, or have already published your analysis."

These are by no means the only environment managers for R and Python, but we’ve found these to be the most reliable and user-friendly for the majority of use cases at Urban.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatives for R\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin the R community, renv, developed and maintained by RStudio, is the de facto virtual environment manager. Older resources might reference packrat, which has been soft-deprecated and is now superseded by renv.  According to the developers of renv,\n\nThe goal is for renv to be a robust, stable replacement for the Packrat package, with fewer surprises and better default behaviors. If you’re using R alongside Python, it may make sense to use conda as your environment manager. Documentation for using R with the Anaconda distribution and conda environment manager is available here. Alternatively, you can use Python with renv, as documented here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatives for Python\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a plethora of virtual environment managers in Python, with a few of the most common being virtualenv, pipenv, poetry, and conda.\nFor data science and research use cases, conda is a popular option for several reasons. First, conda is both an environment manager and a package manager. As a result, conda helps install packages and manage dependencies, whereas other tools rely on pip for package management. Unlike other managers, conda also has native support for programming languages beyond Python (including R). Lastly, conda is extensible, letting you install packages from pip, for example, and offering Miniconda as a lighter-weight alternative or Mamba as an even faster “drop-in replacement” for conda.\nIf you’re using R and Python, conda or renv are good options given their emphasis on interoperability. Documentation for using R with conda is available here, and documentation for using Python with renv is available here."

To install renv, use the standard syntax to install R packages from CRAN: install.packages(\"renv\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere do I run these commands?\n\n\n\nAll commands below should be run in the RStudio console within your project’s directory.\n\n\n\nInitialize a new project-specific environment:\nrenv::init()\nNote that renv::init() creates a .gitignore file for your project, so there is no need to create a .gitignore when you first create your project.\nIf you are using urbntemplates, first run urbntemplates::start_project() with gitignore = FALSE to create the project, then run renv::init() to initialize a project-specific environment.\nInstall packages using your usual workflow or renv::install(), which works with other repositories like GitHub in addition to CRAN:\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")      # install from CRAN\nrenv::install(\"tidyverse/dplyr\") # install from GitHub\nNote that renv can install packages from a variety of sources.\nSave a snapshot of the environment to a file called renv.lock:\nrenv::snapshot()\nShare the snapshot of the environment by sending three files to GitHub: renv.lock, .Rprofile, and renv/activate.R.\nNote that running the renv::init() command in the first step automatically updates your .gitignore file (if relevant) to tell Git which renv files to track.\nRestore the snapshot of the environment on another computer:\nrenv::restore()\nRepeat the process. As you and your collaborators install, update, and remove packages, repeat steps 3-5 to save and load the state of your project to the renv.lock file across computers.\n\n\n\nTo set up a virtual environment for a Python project, we recommend using conda, which is built into the Anaconda distribution through Anaconda or Miniconda. If you haven’t already installed Anaconda, see this guide from a previous Python Users Group session. You can verify that conda is installed and running on your computer with conda --version. If you get an error, see the Anaconda troubleshooting guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere do I run these commands?\n\n\n\nAll commands below should be run from the Anaconda Prompt or a terminal window (e.g. within RStudio or VS Code) from the root of your project’s directory.\n\n\n\nInitialize a new environment (optionally specifying a version of Python and/or a list of packages) using one of the options below. You should replace my_env with a descriptive name specific to your project.\nconda create --name my_env                           # create empty environment  \nconda create --name my_env python==3.7               # create environment with specific Python version \nconda create --name my_env python==3.7 pandas numpy  # create environment with packages installed \nIt’s best practice to specify packages when initializing the environment to let conda help manage dependencies most effectively.\nActivate the environment, again replacing my_env with the name of your environment:\nconda activate my_env\nInstall packages using your usual workflow (optionally specifying the package version) for any packages that you did not include when initializing the environment in the first step:\nconda install pandas         # install default version of pandas \nconda install pandas=0.24.1  # install specific version of pandas \nIt’s best practice to specify the version number associated with a package to ensure that changes in packages over time don’t affect the reproducibility of your code.\nSave a snapshot of the environment to a file called environment.yml.\nconda env export --from-history &gt; environment.yml\nThe from-history flag is necessary to make your environment file work across platforms.\nAlternatively, you can manually create the environment.yml file in the root of your project directory, where it would follow this structure:\nname: my_env\ndependencies:\n  - python=3.7\n  - pandas=0.24\n  - numpy=1.21\nIf you installed packages using pip, the environment.yml file would follow this structure:\nname: my_env\ndependencies:\n  - python=3.7\n  - pandas=0.24\n  - numpy=1.21\n  - pip=19.1\n  - pip:\n    - awscli==1.16\n    - kaggle==1.5\nNote that packages installed using pip use == to specify the version number, while packages installed from conda use =.\nShare the snapshot by sending the environment.yml file to GitHub.\nRestore and activate the snapshot of the environment on another computer:\nconda env create      \nconda activate my_env\nThe conda env create syntax assumes you have a file called environment.yml in your working directory. While you could give this file a different name, we recommend sticking with the convention of naming the file environment.yml and placing it in the root of your project’s directory.\nRepeat the process. As you and your collaborators install, update, and remove packages, repeat steps 4-6 to save and load the state of your project to the environment.yml file across computers."

Think of Git like a turbo-charged version of track changes for code and GitHub as shared drive (like Box) for hosting files tracked with Git.\nVirtual Environments are a way to bundle the packages your code relies on (its dependencies). Someone else can activate your virtual environment on their computer to run your code without having to worry about what packages (and versions of those packages) they have installed locally. You can also use virtual environments on your own computer to work on multiple projects with different dependencies at the same time.\nQuarto is a great publishing system for reproducible research.

    "text": "2 Motivation\nGit and GitHub are tools that can help promote reproducibility through version control. Version control is a system for managing and recording changes to files over time, which can:\n\nLimit the chance of making a mistake\nMaximize the chance of catching a mistake when it happens\nCreate a permanent record of changes to code\nEasily undo mistakes by switching between iterations of code\nAllow multiple paths of development while protecting working versions of code\nEncourage communication between collaborators\nBe used for external communication\n\nGit is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in code. It’s like a turbo-charged version of track changes for code. GitHub is an online hosting service for version control using Git. It also contains useful tools for collaboration and project management. It’s like a turbo-charged version of Box for sharing repositories created using Git.\nThe objective of using Git and GitHub is to create local repositories that track code (and sometimes data) and then push those repositories to GitHub for back-up and collaboration. When someone else edits the code, they can push their changes back to that repository."

Select Settings near the bottom of this drop-down.\nFrom your account settings, navigate to Developer Settings, at the bottom of the menu on the left.\nFrom the developer settings, navigate to Personal Access Tokens in the menu on the left.\nClick Generate new token (classic). You may be prompted to re-enter your GitHub password.\nAdd a note to label the token. This is useful if you intend to generate multiple tokens for different uses. Then, set a time limit for the token – you can set this to never expire. Finally, select the scope of permissions you would like to give the token - you can select all options. Then click Generate token.\nThe generated token will appear. Make sure to copy and safely store the token when it appears, as you will not be able to view it again. Note that if you lose your token, you can always generate a new one. Use this in place of your GitHub password when prompted by Git (or when using the GitHub API).\n\nThe first time you attempt to clone (copy to your computer) a repository that is private on GitHub, Git will prompt you for your credentials. Your username is just your GitHub username. Your password should be the PAT that you created."

Drop a message in the #github Slack channel if you run into issues.\nCan I use Git and GitHub with projects that have confidential data stored on the Y Drive?\nYes! Read this guide for tips on how to do so.\nShould I use Git inside of Box? (i.e. turn a Box folder into a Git repository)\nNo – we strongly recommend keeping Box folders and GitHub repositories separate.\nWhat kinds of files should I track with Git?\nGenerally, you should only track code (i.e., scripts written in R, Stata, SAS, Python, etc.) with Git. You should not track large data files or binary files (i.e., Word, Excel files). There are occasions when tracking small data files with Git might make sense, but you should never store confidential data on GitHub (even in a private repository). We recommend getting familiar with .gitignore files, which can prevent you and your collaborators from accidentally pushing files to GitHub. GitHub provides hundreds of template .gitignore files for specific programming languages (e.g. R, Stata, or Python) or operating systems (e.g. Windows or MacOS) that can be useful as a starting point.\nHow do I add documentation to my repositories?\nUse README files to add context and documentation to your repos. These are Markdown files in the root of your directory named README.md that can help folks understand the structure and contents of your repo. Markdown Live Preview can be a useful tool to help with formatting.\nWhat permissions should I give my collaborators?\nIn general, you should follow the principle of least privilege, which means that you should give folks the minimum level of access they need, but no more than that. In most cases, this will be the Write role, but you should refer to GitHub’s guide describing the different roles and what they allow. If you need elevated permissions for a repository, post a message in the #github Slack channel.\nAre there other commands that can be helpful when using Git from the command line?\nDefinitely! Learning a few simple Bash commands can be helpful for navigating the command line. A few common commands include pwd (to print your current directory), cd (to change directories), and ls (to list the files in a directory). For an introduction to these commands and others, we recommend this guide from Friendly Django or this guide from Happy Git with R."

So while changes to your scripts will be tracked with all the power of GitHub, your data will not.\nIf your project only has non-sensitive data files, it is best practice to put the data and scripts directly in the same Git repo as that makes it easier to work with collaborators and quickly understand project structures. But if you work with confidential data, you can’t put your data in Git/GitHub for security reasons (and therefore won’t get the power of Git and file tracking for the data).\nNow that’s out of the way, how do you setup Git/GitHub with your confidential data?"
