Under the hood, all those visual interfaces just use the command line.\nTo run Git commands from the command line on a Windows computer, right click within any directory (i.e. folder) on your computer, and select Git Bash Here. Alternatively, if you already use an IDE like RStudio or VS Code, you can use the terminal within these IDEs directly to run commands. You can also read more about the command line in this tutorial.\nThroughout this guide, code chunks that begin with $ indicate when you should run a command from the command line, although you should not include the $ symbol when submitting the command:\n::: {.cell}\n$ <run_this_command> \n:::\n<> are used to indicate blanks that need to be filled in.

Then, click Settings (along the top) and Collaborators and Teams (along the left side panel). Click the relevant buttons to add people (individual users) or teams (groups of users).\nTeams are useful if you have a set of users who will all need access to multiple repositories. Creating a team saves you from having to add each user individually for each new repo. Urban has 50+ teams on GitHub for specific projects (e.g. Education Data Team for folks across TECH, COMMS, and EDP who work on the Education Data Portal) or teams or centers within Urban (e.g. Data Science or HFPC).\n\n\nBasic commands and workflow\nThe most common Git commands you will use include git add, git commit, and git push. These tell Git which files to track, when to take snapshots of those files, and when to send those snapshots to GitHub for others to see.\n\ngit add adds a file to Git’s staging area. It tells Git, “hey, look at this file.”\n::: {.cell}\n$ git add <file_name>\n:::\ngit commit commits changes made to added files to the repository. It says, “hey, take a snapshot of the files I’ve added.”\n::: {.cell}\n$ git commit -m \"<message>\" \n:::\ngit status prints out important information about your repo. Use it before and after most commands to understand how files have changed in your repo.\n::: {.cell}\n$ git status \n:::\ngit push pushes your local commits to the remote repository on GitHub. It says, “hey, push all my snapshots to a shared folder so that other people can see them.” The command below will push to the default main branch of your repo. Note that for repositories created before August 2021, the default branch was called master, instead of main.\n::: {.cell}\n$ git push origin main\n:::\n\nBefore running the git push command, your code and commits could only be accessed on your local computer."

When working individually, this will just be your local version. When working with others, you should pull down the latest changes that anyone has pushed remotely before making further updates.\n\ngit pull copies the latest changes that anyone has pushed remotely to your local repository. It says, “hey, replace my local version with the current version on GitHub.” The command below will pull the latest version on the main branch.\n::: {.cell}\n$ git pull origin main\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBranches\nSo far in this guide, we’ve been working off a single main branch. By using multiple branches, you and your collaborators can update existing code or add new code without the fear of overwriting each others’ files. Branches let you say “hey, I’m going to leave the main version of the code alone while I try some things out over here.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngit checkout switches your local version to different branch. The -b flag in the command below tells Git to first create a new branch and then switch to it. When you first create a new branch, it will be identical to the local version of the branch that you switched from (typically the main branch).\n::: {.cell}\n$ git checkout -b <name_of_new_branch> \n:::\ngit branch will tell you what branch you are currently on.

This says, “hey, I’d like to merge the work on my branch into the main (or some other) branch.” Pull requests makes it easy for others to see the changes you’ve made and provide feedback. They also help organize multiple related commits into a single update.\nThe most common way to open, review, and merge a pull request is through GitHub, rather than from the command line. Different teams develop their own standards for branching and pull requests, but here’s a common workflow:\n\nFrom your repo, click Pull requests (along the top) and then click the green New pull request button.\nSelect the branch with your work. By default, GitHub will create a pull request into the main branch.\nReview the files that have changed to ensure you don’t accidentally merge files you don’t intend to into the main branch.\nClick Create pull request. Write a summary of the updates included in the pull request and why you made those updates. You can also add Reviewers (along the right panel) to notify others that you would like them to look at your changes.\nTo make changes to the code included in a pull request if (e.g. if a reviewer requests updates), simply push to the same branch. The pull request will automatically be updated to reflect these changes.\nOnce approved, merge the pull request into the main branch by clicking the green Merge or Rebase and merge button.\nOnce your branch has been merged, delete it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter merging the pull request, you should return to the main branch and sync your local directory with the merged changes:\n\ngit checkout switches your local version to a different branch.\n::: {.cell}\n$ git checkout main\n:::\ngit pull copies the latest changes from the pull request that you just merged remotely to your local repository. If you don’t explicitly specify a branch when running the git pull command, Git will pull from the branch you are currently on.\n::: {.cell}\n$ git pull\n:::"

Before long, you’ll have that workflow down and will be ready to start using multiple branches and opening pull requests.\nThis guide is meant to be an introduction. Git and GitHub have hundreds of useful commands and features not discussed here. Different folks and teams also have different opinions on workflows and best practices for using these tools. Once you have a grasp of the basics, we encourage you to start exploring to find a workflow that works for you.\nYou will inevitably run into errors along the way, but learning how to resolve those will make you a better researcher, programmer, and problem solver.

    "text": "FAQs\n\nGit and GitHub seem a little scary. How do I get started?\nStart by using these tools for solo work. It is the lowest stakes way to develop skills that will be valuable for collaboration.\nWhere can I go for help if I get stuck?\nRunning into errors is an inevitable part of working with Git and GitHub, but we’re here to help! Drop a message in the #github Slack channel when you have issues, or email Aaron Williams (awilliams@urban.org) or Erika Tyagi (etyagi@urban.org).\nCan I use Git and GitHub with projects that have confidential data stored on the Y Drive?\nYes! Read this guide for tips on how to do so.\nShould I use Git inside of Box? (i.e. turn a Box folder into a Git repository)\nNo – we strongly recommend keeping Box folders and GitHub repositories separate.\nWhat kinds of files should I track with Git?\nGenerally, you should only track code (i.e. scripts written in R, Stata, SAS, Python, etc.) with Git. You should not track large data files or binary files (i.e. Word, Excel files). There are occasions when tracking small data files with Git might make sense, but you should never store confidential data on GitHub (even in a private repository). We recommend getting familiar with .gitignore files, which can prevent you and your collaborators from accidentally pushing files to GitHub. GitHub provides hundreds of template .gitignore files for specific programming languages (e.g. R, Stata, or Python) or operating systems (e.g. Windows or MacOS) that can be useful as a starting point.\nHow do I add documentation to my repositories?\nUse README files to add context and documentation to your repos. These are Markdown files in the root of your directory named README.md that can help folks understand the structure and contents of your repo. Markdown Live Preview can be a useful tool to help with formatting.\nWhat permissions should I give my collaborators?\nIn general, you should follow the principle of least privilege, which means that you should give folks the minimum level of access they need, but no more than that. In most cases, this will be the Write role, but you should refer to GitHub’s guide describing the different roles and what they allow. If you need elevated permissions for a repository, post a message in the #github Slack channel.\nAre there other commands that can be helpful when using Git from the command line?\nDefinitely! Learning a few simple Bash commands can be helpful for navigating the command line. A few common commands include pwd (to print your current directory), cd (to change directories), and ls (to list the files in a directory). For an introduction to these, and other, commands, we recommend this guide from Friendly Django or this guide from Happy Git with R.\nWhere did the cute images in this guide come from?\nThose are GitHub’s mascot, the Octocat. You can read more about the history of Octocats here and check out the full set of Octocats that GitHub has created here."

    "text": "1 Why should I use a virtual environment?\nVirtual environments promote reproducibility by letting you let you specify project-specific versions of packages. They accomplish this by making it easy to take a snapshot of the version of packages used in a project and restore that snapshot on other computers. They also make it easy to switch between snapshots on a single computer as you switch between projects.\nTo make this more concrete, here’s a few situations when setting up a virtual environment can save you several hours (or even days!) of frustration:\n\nYou published an analysis based on 2021 data. A year later, you want to update the analysis with 2022 data, but your code no longer works because a function in a package was updated.\nYour coworker is running into errors running your code because of differences in package versions between your computers.\nYou need to use Python 2.7 for a legacy project, while using Python 3.7 for all other projects.\nYou want to use a new library that has known compatibility issues with Python 3.8 on Windows computers, so you want to use Python 3.7 for just one specific project.\nYou got a new computer and don’t want to spend hours remembering which R packages to install through endless Error in library(<>): there is no package called '<>' errors.\nYour code takes a long time to run locally, so you want to leverage powerful virtual computers in the cloud - or scale to use tens, hundreds, or thousands of computers simultaneously - but you first need to install the relevant packages on the virtual machine(s).\n\nImportantly, virtual environments are just one piece of reproducible research workflows - they are NOT replacements for other important components of reproducibility like version control, directory management, or data provenance."

    "text": "2 When should I use a virtual environment?\nIdeally, always. You’ll be more likely to regret NOT setting up a virtual environment for a project down the line than to regret spending a few minutes doing so for a project that didn’t necessarily require one. Getting into the habit of using virtual environments for smaller projects will also help you develop confidence when using them for larger projects with more collaborators and complex dependencies.\nWhile the best time to set up a virtual environment for a project is at the very beginning (right after initializing your GitHub repository), the second best time is right now - whether you’re halfway through writing your code, ready to publish your results, or have already published your analysis."

    "section": "3 Which environment manager should I use?",
    "text": "3 Which environment manager should I use?\nFor R projects, we recommend using renv. For Python projects, we recommend using conda. These are by no means the only environment managers for R and Python, but we’ve found these to be the most reliable and user-friendly for the majority of use cases at Urban.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatives for R\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin the R community, renv, developed and maintained by RStudio, is the de facto virtual environment manager. Older resources might reference packrat, which has been soft-deprecated and is now superseded by renv. According to the developers of renv,\n\nThe goal is for renv to be a robust, stable replacement for the Packrat package, with fewer surprises and better default behaviors. If you’re using R alongside Python, it may make sense to use conda as your environment manager. Documentation for using R with the Anaconda distribution and conda environment manager is available here. Alternatively, you can use Python with renv, as documented here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatives for Python\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a plethora of virtual environment managers in Python, with a few of the most common being virtualenv, pipenv, poetry, and conda.\nFor data science and research use cases, conda is a popular option for several reasons. First, conda is both an environment manager and a package manager. As a result, conda helps install packages and manage dependencies, whereas other tools rely on pip for package management. Unlike other managers, conda also has native support for programming languages beyond Python (including R). Lastly, conda is extensible, letting you install packages from pip, for example, and offering Miniconda as a lighter-weight alternative or Mambda as an even faster “drop-in replacement” for conda.\nIf you’re using R and Python, conda or renv are good options given their emphasis on interoperability. Documentation for using R with conda is available here, and documentation for using Python with renv is available here."

To install renv, use the standard syntax to install R packages from CRAN: install.packages(\"renv\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere do I run these commands?\n\n\n\nAll commands below should be run from RStudio within your project’s directory.\n\n\n\nInitialize a new project-specific environment:\nrenv::init()\nInstall packages using your usual workflow:\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")      # install from CRAN\nrenv::install(\"tidyverse/dplyr\") # install from GitHub\nNote that renv can install packages from a variety of sources including CRAN, GitHub, and Bioconductor.\nSave a snapshot of the environment to a file called renv.lock:\nrenv::snapshot()\nShare the snapshot of the environment by sending three files to GitHub: renv.lock, .Rprofile, and renv/activate.R.\nNote that running the renv::init() command in the first step automatically updates your .gitignore file (if relevant) to tell Git which renv files to track.\nRestore the snapshot of the environment on another computer:\nrenv::restore()\nRepeat the process. As you and your collaborators install, update, and remove packages, repeat steps 3-5 to save and load the state of your project to the renv.lock file across computers.\n\n\n\nTo set up a virtual environment for a Python project, we recommend using conda, which is built into the Anaconda distribution through Anaconda or Miniconda. If you haven’t already installed Anaconda, see this guide from a previous Python Users Group session. You can verify that conda is installed and running on your computer with conda --version. If you get an error, see the Anaconda troubleshooting guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere do I run these commands?\n\n\n\nAll commands below should be run from the Anaconda Prompt or a terminal window (e.g. within RStudio or VS Code) from the root of your project’s directory.\n\n\n\nInitialize a new environment (optionally specifying a version of Python and/or a list of packages) using one of the options below. You should replace my_env with a descriptive name specific to your project.\nconda create --name my_env                           # create empty environment  \nconda create --name my_env python==3.7               # create environment with specific Python version \nconda create --name my_env python==3.7 pandas numpy  # create environment with packages installed \nIt’s best practice to specify packages when initializing the environment to let conda help manage dependencies most effectively.\nActivate the environment, again replacing my_env with the name of your environment:\nconda activate my_env\nInstall packages using your usual workflow (optionally specifying the package version) for any packages that you did not include when initializing the environment in the first step:\nconda install pandas         # install default version of pandas \nconda install pandas=0.24.1  # install specific version of pandas \nIt’s best practice to specify the version number associated with a package to ensure that changes in packages over time don’t affect the reproducibility of your code.\nSave a snapshot of the environment to a file called environment.yml.\nconda env export --from-history > environment.yml\nThe from-history flag is necessary to make your environment file work across platforms.\nAlternatively, you can manually create the environment.yml file in the root of your project directory, where it would follow this structure:\nname: my_env\ndependencies:\n  - python=3.7\n  - pandas=0.24\n  - numpy=1.21\nIf you installed packages using pip, the environment.yml file would follow this structure:\nname: my_env\ndependencies:\n  - python=3.7\n  - pandas=0.24\n  - numpy=1.21\n  - pip=19.1\n  - pip:\n    - awscli==1.16\n    - kaggle==1.5\nNote that packages installed using pip use == to specify the version number, while packages installed from conda use =.\nShare the snapshot by sending the environment.yml file to GitHub.\nRestore and activate the snapshot of the environment on another computer:\nconda env create      \nconda activate my_env\nThe conda env create syntax assumes you have a file called environment.yml in your working directory. While you could give this file a different name, we recommend sticking with the convention of naming the file environment.yml and placing it in the root of your project’s directory.\nRepeat the process. As you and your collaborators install, update, and remove packages, repeat steps 4-6 to save and load the state of your project to the environment.yml file across computers."
