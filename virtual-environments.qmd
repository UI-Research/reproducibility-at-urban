This guide is intended to help R and Python users at the Urban Institute start using virtual environments. This guide assumes familiarity with Git and GitHub (see <a href="https://ui-research.github.io/reproducibility-at-urban/git-workflow.html" target="_blank">this guide</a> if you are not familiar with these tools) and is focused on helping folks start using virtual environments without having to meaningfully modify their existing workflows.

## Why should I use a virtual environment?

Virtual environments promote reproducibility by letting you let you specify project-specific versions of packages. They accomplish this by making it easy to take a snapshot of the version of packages used in a project and restore that snapshot on other computers. They also make it easy to switch between snapshots on a single computer as you switch between projects.

To make this more concrete, here's a few situations when setting up a virtual environment can save you several hours (or even days!) of frustration:

-   You published an analysis based on 2021 data. A year later, you want to update the analysis with 2022 data, but your code no longer works because a function in a package was updated.
-   Your coworker is running into errors running your code because of differences in package versions between your computers.
-   You need to use Python 2.7 for a legacy project, while using Python 3.7 for all other projects.
-   You want to use a new library that has known compatibility issues with Python 3.8 on Windows computers, so you want to use Python 3.7 for just one specific project.
-   You got a new computer and don't want to spend hours remembering which R packages to install through endless `Error in library(<>): there is no package called '<>'` errors.
-   Your code takes a long time to run locally, so you want to leverage powerful <a href="http://tech-tools.urban.org/ec2-submission/" target="_blank">virtual computers in the cloud</a> - or scale to use tens, hundreds, or thousands of computers simultaneously - but you first need to install the relevant packages on the virtual machine(s).

Importantly, virtual environments are just one piece of reproducible research workflows - they are NOT replacements for other important components of reproducibility like version control, directory management, or data provenance.

## When should I use a virtual environment?

Ideally, always. You'll be more likely to regret NOT setting up a virtual environment for a project down the line than to regret spending a few minutes doing so for a project that didn't necessarily require one. Getting into the habit of using virtual environments for smaller projects will also help you develop confidence when using them for larger projects with more collaborators and complex dependencies.

While the best time to set up a virtual environment for a project is at the very beginning (right after initializing your GitHub repository), the second best time is right now - whether you're halfway through writing your code, ready to publish your results, or have already published your analysis.

## Which environment manager should I use?

For R projects, we recommend using `renv`. For Python projects, we recommend using `conda`. These are by no means the only environment managers for R and Python, but we've found these to be the most reliable and user-friendly for the majority of use cases at Urban.

### Alternatives for R

Within the R community, `renv`, developed and <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/renv/" target="_blank">maintained by RStudio</a>, is the de facto virtual environment manager. Older resources might reference `packrat`, which has been <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/packrat#note" target="_blank">soft-deprecated</a> and is now superseded by `renv`. <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/renv/vignettes/renv.html" target="_blank"> According to the developers</a> of `renv`,

> The goal is for `renv` to be a robust, stable replacement for the Packrat package, with fewer surprises and better default behaviors. If you're using R alongside Python, it may make sense to use `conda` as your environment manager. Documentation for using R with the Anaconda distribution and `conda` environment manager is available <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/using-r-language/" target="_blank">here</a>. Alternatively, you can use Python with `renv`, as documented <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/python.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Alternatives for Python

There is a plethora of virtual environment managers in Python, with a few of the most common being `virtualenv`, `pipenv`, `poetry`, and `conda`.

For data science and research use cases, `conda` is a popular option for several reasons. First, `conda` is both an environment manager and a package manager. As a result, `conda` helps install packages and manage dependencies, whereas other tools rely on `pip` for package management. Unlike other managers, `conda` also has native support for programming languages beyond Python (including R). Lastly, `conda` is extensible, letting you install packages from `pip`, for example, and offering <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html" target="_blank">Miniconda</a> as a lighter-weight alternative or <a href="https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html" target="_blank">Mamba</a> as an even faster "drop-in replacement" for `conda`.

If you're using R and Python, `conda` or `renv` are good options given their emphasis on interoperability. Documentation for using R with `conda` is available <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/using-r-language/" target="_blank">here</a>, and documentation for using Python with `renv` is available <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/python.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Workflow and commands

::: panel-tabset
### R

To set up a virtual environment for an <a href="https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects" target="_blank">R project</a>, we recommend using `renv`. To install `renv`, use the standard syntax to install R packages from CRAN: `install.packages("renv")`.

::: callout-note
## Where do I run these commands?

All commands below should be run in the RStudio console within your project's directory.
:::

1.  **Initialize** a new project-specific environment:

    ``` r
    renv::init()
    ```

    Note that `renv::init()` creates a `.gitignore` file for your project, so there is no need to create a `.gitignore` when you first create your project. 
    
    If you are using <a href="https://github.com/UrbanInstitute/urbntemplates/blob/main/README.md" target="_blank">urbntemplates</a>, first run `urbntemplates::start_project()` with `gitignore = FALSE` to create the project, then run `renv::init()` to initialize a project-specific environment.

2.  **Install packages** using your usual workflow or `renv::install()`, which works with other repositories like GitHub in addition to CRAN:

    ``` r
    install.packages("ggplot2")      # install from CRAN
    renv::install("tidyverse/dplyr") # install from GitHub
    ```

    Note that `renv` can install packages from a <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html#package-sources" target="_blank">variety of sources</a>.

3.  **Save** a snapshot of the environment to a file called `renv.lock`:

    ``` r
    renv::snapshot()
    ```

4.  **Share** the snapshot of the environment by sending three files to GitHub: `renv.lock`, `.Rprofile`, and `renv/activate.R`.

    Note that running the `renv::init()` command in the first step automatically updates your `.gitignore` file (if relevant) to tell Git which `renv` files to track.

5.  **Restore** the snapshot of the environment on another computer:

    ``` r
    renv::restore()
    ```

6.  **Repeat** the process. As you and your collaborators install, update, and remove packages, repeat steps 3-5 to save and load the state of your project to the `renv.lock` file across computers.

### Python

To set up a virtual environment for a Python project, we recommend using `conda`, which is built into the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution" target="_blank">Anaconda distribution</a> through Anaconda or <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html" target="_blank">Miniconda</a>. If you haven't already installed Anaconda, see <a href="https://github.com/UI-Research/python-resources/blob/main/notebooks/anaconda-installation.ipynb" target="_blank">this guide</a> from a previous Python Users Group session. You can verify that `conda` is installed and running on your computer with `conda --version`. If you get an error, see the Anaconda <a href="https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/troubleshooting.html" target="_blank">troubleshooting guide</a>.

::: callout-note
## Where do I run these commands?

All commands below should be run from the Anaconda Prompt or a terminal window (e.g. within RStudio or VS Code) from the root of your project's directory.
:::

1.  **Initialize** a new environment (optionally specifying a version of Python and/or a list of packages) using one of the options below. You should replace `my_env` with a descriptive name specific to your project.

    ``` python
    conda create --name my_env                           # create empty environment  
    conda create --name my_env python==3.7               # create environment with specific Python version 
    conda create --name my_env python==3.7 pandas numpy  # create environment with packages installed 
    ```

    It's best practice to specify packages when initializing the environment to let `conda` help manage dependencies most effectively.

2.  **Activate** the environment, again replacing `my_env` with the name of your environment:

    ``` python
    conda activate my_env
    ```

3.  **Install packages** using your usual workflow (optionally specifying the package version) for any packages that you did not include when initializing the environment in the first step:

    ``` python
    conda install pandas         # install default version of pandas 
    conda install pandas=0.24.1  # install specific version of pandas 
    ```

    It's best practice to specify the version number associated with a package to ensure that changes in packages over time don't affect the reproducibility of your code.

4.  **Save** a snapshot of the environment to a file called `environment.yml`.

    ``` python
    conda env export --from-history > environment.yml
    ```

    The `from-history` flag is necessary to make your environment file work across platforms.

    Alternatively, you can manually create the `environment.yml` file in the root of your project directory, where it would follow this structure:

    ``` python
    name: my_env
    dependencies:
      - python=3.7
      - pandas=0.24
      - numpy=1.21
    ```

    If you installed packages using `pip`, the `environment.yml` file would follow this structure:

    ``` python
    name: my_env
    dependencies:
      - python=3.7
      - pandas=0.24
      - numpy=1.21
      - pip=19.1
      - pip:
        - awscli==1.16
        - kaggle==1.5
    ```

    Note that packages installed using `pip` use `==` to specify the version number, while packages installed from `conda` use `=`.

5.  **Share** the snapshot by sending the `environment.yml` file to GitHub.

6.  **Restore** and activate the snapshot of the environment on another computer:

    ``` python
    conda env create      
    conda activate my_env
    ```

    The `conda env create` syntax assumes you have a file called `environment.yml` in your working directory. While you could give this file a different name, we recommend sticking with the convention of naming the file `environment.yml` and placing it in the root of your project's directory.

7.  **Repeat** the process. As you and your collaborators install, update, and remove packages, repeat steps 4-6 to save and load the state of your project to the `environment.yml` file across computers.

### Python

We recommend keeping the official `conda` <a href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf" target="_blank">cheat sheet</a> handy.

In addition to the commands included above, a few other commonly used `conda` commands include:

-   `conda deactivate` deactivates the current environment
-   `conda list` lists all packages in the current environment
-   `conda env list` lists all environments (with the current active environment asterisked)
-   `conda env remove -n my_env` deletes the `my_env` environment

The <a href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html" target="_blank">official documentation</a> and <a href="https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/introduction-to-conda-for-data-scientists/04-sharing-environments/index.html" target="_blank">this guide</a> from the Carpentries are also helpful resources.
